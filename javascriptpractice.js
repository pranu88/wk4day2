// =========================
//  VARIABLES AND DATATYPES
// =========================
// 1.How do we assign a value to a variable?
// let color = 'red'

// 2.How do we change the value of a variable?
// color = 'blue'

// 3.How do we assign an existing variable to a new variable?
// let newColor = color

// 4.Remind me, what are declare, assign, and define?
// Declare: We create a variable by using keyword "let" or "const"
// Assign: giving a value after declaring a variable
// Define: giving a variable its initial datatype

// 5.What is pseudocoding and why should you do it?
// What is: pseudocoding is a way to write a description of a computer program or algorithm in plain english.
// Why is: We should use to simplify and planning the program in small logical steps.

// 6.What percentage of time should be spent thinking about how you're going to solve a problem vs actually typing in code to solve it?
// A reasonable amount spent in planning in solving the problem is between 50% to 70% and for coding it takes 50% to 30%.

//        STRINGS
//=======================

// 1. Create a variable called firstVariable
let firstVariable
// 2.Assign it the value of the string "Hello World"
firstVariable = "Hello World"
// 3. Change the value of this variable to some number
firstVariable = 12
// 4. Store the value of firstVariablein a new variable called secondVariable
let secondVariable = firstVariable
// 5. Change the value of secondVariableto any string.
secondVariable = "prescholas"
// 6.What is the value of firstVariable?
// 12
// 7. Create a variable called yourNameand set it equal to your name as a string. Then, write an expression that takes the string "Hello, my name is " and the variable yourNameso that it returns a new string with them concatenated.
const yourName = "Pranusha"
// console.log("Hello, my name is "+yourName)
let newString = "Hello, my name is "+yourName
